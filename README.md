# What does this Repo do

Just a repo for my daily studying note, which may contains some English part, not fully chinese. 

Some of them may be published somewhere, such as:

- WeChat: theheretIx

- Juejin: theheretIx

And there will be a plan for my schedule, but it's not totally correct, it's all depends on my thought.

## Current Plan

Fisrt, let me explain some state shortcut:

- p: processing
- is: in-scheduled
- st: still a thought
- d: done
- i: sth just interest in



Then, the concrete schedule as follows:

- { d} : 
  - Safepoint
  - Netty series
  - Deep dive: JUC AQS
  - Deep dive: Spring @Transactional
- { p} 
  - G1 80% : translation left only, and some graphic
  - Happens-before 70% : same as JMM below
  - JVM Bytecode 90% : still some question
  - JVM memory concrete layout 99% : just don't want to publish and a little confuse
  - JMM 70% : don't know how to explain some concept
- {st}
- {is}
  - JIT compiler
- { i}
  - finite state machine, framework and detail, event-driven architecture 
  - ZGC & Shenandoah GC, video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU_mqNBEacw&t=1030s
